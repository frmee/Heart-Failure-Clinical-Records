## Heart-Failure-Clinical-Records

## Problem Statement:
Using The Key Influencers Visual in Power BI to analyze deadth event based on ejection fraction and serum creatinine, check on what level of these two features that the patients will survive, and compare their relative importance.
The result will have two tabs: the Key influencers tab, which will analyze each element separately, and the Top segments tab, which will show how a combination of factors influences the rate of survival.

## Data
The dataset contains the medical records of 299 heart failure patients who were tracked throughout their therapy, with each patient profile having 13 clinical variables. Among these patients, 96 individuals unfortunately passed away, while 203 patients survived.
